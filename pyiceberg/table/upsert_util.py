def build_balanced_tree(operator_: Callable[[T, T], T], items: List[T]) -> T:
    """
    Recursively constructs a balanced binary tree of expressions using the provided binary operator.

    This function is a safer and more scalable alternative to:
        reduce(operator_, items)

    Using reduce creates a deeply nested, unbalanced tree (e.g., operator_(a, operator_(b, operator_(c, ...)))),
    which grows linearly with the number of items. This can lead to RecursionError exceptions in Python
    when the number of expressions is large (e.g., >1000).

    In contrast, this function builds a balanced binary tree with logarithmic depth (O(log n)),
    helping avoid recursion issues and ensuring that expression trees remain stable, predictable,
    and safe to traverse â€” especially in tools like PyIceberg that operate on large logical trees.

    Parameters:
        operator_ (Callable[[T, T], T]): A binary operator function (e.g., pyiceberg.expressions.Or, And).
        items (List[T]): A list of expression objects to combine.

    Returns:
        T: An expression object representing the balanced combination of all input expressions.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input list is empty.
